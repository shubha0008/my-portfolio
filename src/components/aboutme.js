      Hi, Iâ€™m Shubha Rashmi and I Specialize in Full Stack Development with NodeJS in frontend . I learnt Full Stack by doing projects on my own . I am an enthusiast and wants to learn as much possible in coding .
      During Graduation I had Electronics and communication as my stream . But I found coding more interesting and learnt C++ and Java  .
      I want to have my expertise in Javascript language so I am learning and working on it . I have done few projects in React . I am looking for opportunity so that I can learn and apply my knowledge and skills in a large-scale Project . 
      </p>
